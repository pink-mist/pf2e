## Ancestral Might
###Feat 1
`Exemplar` `Ikon`
* **Prerequisites**: *Humble Strikes*, Ancestral Weapon Familiarity or a similar feat (like Unconventional Weaponry) that treats a specific martial or advanced weapon as a simple weapon for proficiency purposes.
* **Usage**: one of your weapon ikons that you have familiarity with via a prerequisite feat.

Your divine spark recognizes the inherent potential within the traditional arms of your lineage, elevating them to a stature worthy of your legend.

**Immanence**: As long as your divine spark is empowering this ikon, the weapon is treated as a simple weapon for the purpose of your *Humble Strikes* class feature, even if it is a martial or advanced weapon. This allows your *Humble Strikes* to increase the weapon's damage die size by one step.
