## Background
Miyama Daisuke was born into a wealthy family in Liu An where he enjoyed the finest education his parents
could afford. He had a younger sister, Miyama Inoue, while he was growing up who was born with a wasting
sickness that sadly took her life in her 10th year of life. The whole family had dedicated their whole
energy to keep Miyama Inoue alive. Daisuke was always protective of her and after the funeral he went to
study medicine in the city of Sze where he dedicated all his time to understanding her illness and he
became a skilled physician. His time away shaped him into a man of supreme confidence (if not outright
arrogance) convinced that his intellect and knowledge set him above the ordinary folk of Liu An.

Upon returning, Daisuke set his sights on an ambitious goal: to establish Liu An's first medical
university, turning the town into a center of learning and progress. To him this would not only improve
the lives of its citizens but also secure his place in history. He holds himself to the highest standard,
having exceptional healing abilities, believing that recognition and greatness are earned through
achievement, not sentiment - though his bedside manner leaves much to be desired. However, beneath his
haughty demeanor lies a desire for validation - proof that his knowledge can shape not only the future of
Liu An, but the world beyond.
