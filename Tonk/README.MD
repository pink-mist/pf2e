## Background

Tonk never fit in with his Goblin tribe, he didn't find it fun to harass the
local villagers. He wasn't interested in watching the fires burn down their
houses ... Except ... The smell of roasting meat! The fat juices dripping down
into the fires and creating small explosions of fragrance! Ohh, and the smells
of all the different spices and herbs the villagers had! They had nothing like
this in his tribe! Every time they went on a raid he kept his eyes out and his
nostrils peeled for any hint of interesting food and seasoning. Sometimes when
they were scouting a place he spied people reading something while they were
cooking. ... Recipes! This was a word he learned while he was still young and
it was the most important thing in his world! He spent years during raids
trying to figure out what the scribbles meant, and in the end he learned to
read and write! Especially when it came to food! He tried to get his fellow
Goblins to try putting some seasoning on their BBQed rats but none of them were
even remotely interested. He tried showing them how to make a tasty stew that
would last for days during the winter months but they always just sabotaged his
attempts. After a while Tonk realised he couldn't stay here with his Goblin
tribe doing Goblin things and eating Goblin food. It wasn't for him. And every
single time he tried to cook something good, the others would get in his way,
some trying to fight him while he was chopping an onion, others taking the meat
from the pot just when it was starting to cook. They'd rip his carefully
collected recipes to shreds when he wasn't looking.

In the end, he had enough. He would haveto leave and fend for himself on the
way.

He travelled far and wide. Nowhere would accept him, but he spied on the cooks,
sometimes stealing a pie from a windowsill, and learned of the different foods
people were eating. He loved it all. He just wished he didn't have to hide all
the time.

After much travelling he eventually made it to Alkenstar. Alkenstar was
different. There were all kinds of creatures and people here. Nobody even
batted an eye at a Goblin walking around. There were weirder folks around after
all. He finally managed to get a job in a kitchen. At first they wouldn't let
him anywhere near the food, he was just the busboy, there to clean the dishes.
This was something he had never done before, so it was quite challenging, but
he was a quick learner and soon got the hang of it. He always kept an eye out
for what the chefs were doing, and soon enough he got a chance to help out. One
of the chefs got ill and couldn't come in to work. Tonk didn't hesitate. He had
seen what needed to be done, and he did it. Quickly. Correctly. Professionally.
The other staff were shocked. But the customers couldn't see him, and they all
sent compliments to the chef via the waiters. After a few hours even the
other chefs seemed to accept him, though they made sure to always check there
was nothing wrong with his dishes. Sigh. At least he finally got to cook.
Properly.

And then disaster struck. They were in the middle of the evening service when
the Shieldmarshals barged in for an "inspection". As soon as they saw Tonk with
a knife in hand, chopping some vegetables they came down on him like a
thundercloud. It all happened so fast but he was quickly cast out of the
restaurant, and he couldn't get any job in that part of town anywhere close to
a kitchen again.

After a couple of days while trying to find other work, he had run into one of
the waiters from the restaurant, and he told Tonk that the chef that hadn't
come in to work that day had been resentful that he wasn't paid enough. So he
had decided to try to get the restaurant to fail during their busiest day of
the year, but with Tonk's help they had managed to serve all their customers
without problem, and that had made the chef even angrier, so he had called on
his cousin, a corrupt Shieldmarshal who asked Anjelique Loveless to make
trouble for them.
